# learning-redux-course-files

A set of exercise files for the **Learning Redux** [course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-redux) by Alex Banks, updated for 2020 with React 16, Webpack 4, and Babel 7.

Also includes the **Ch04/04_04** folder missing from the original!

This could have been a fork of the [original](https://github.com/MoonTahoe/ski-day-counter-redux) repository, but that appears to be pretty much dead, with a pull request pending and issues unresolved for more than two years now. So this code has simply been reworked from the ZIP file available with the course.
